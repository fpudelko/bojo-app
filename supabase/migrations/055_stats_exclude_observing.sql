-- 055: Keep "observing" RSVPs (rsvp = 'maybe') out of player stats.
--
-- Observing means "I'm watching this match", not "I took part" — it reserves no
-- spot. Counting it inflated events_joined (and could inflate attended), which
-- made the profile look like the player had games they never signed up for.
--
-- matches_played already excluded them implicitly (observers are stored with
-- is_reserve = true), but the condition is now explicit so the intent survives
-- any future change to how observing rows are stored.
